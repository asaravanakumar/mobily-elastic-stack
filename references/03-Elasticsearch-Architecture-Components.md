# Elasticsearch Architecture Components and Internals

## Cluster

- The **cluster** is the highest-level container in Elasticsearch consisting of one or more nodes.
- A cluster is identified by a unique name, and all nodes in that cluster must use the same name to communicate.
- It manages the distribution and replication of data and coordinates indexing and search operations across the cluster.
- The cluster state keeps metadata about indices, nodes, shards, mappings, and configuration, ensuring consistency between nodes.

## Nodes

- A **node** is a single running instance of Elasticsearch inside the cluster.
- Nodes hold data and perform data operations (indexing, search).
- Roles of nodes:
  - **Master node**: Controls cluster-wide operations like managing metadata, node additions/removals, and shard allocations.
  - **Data node**: Stores data and handles CRUD, search, and aggregation operations.
  - **Ingest node**: Preprocesses documents before indexing (pipeline execution).
  - **Coordinating node**: Acts as a smart load balancer and query router, forwarding requests to relevant nodes and aggregating results (all non-data nodes act as coordinating).
- Nodes communicate using Elasticsearch transport protocol over TCP.

## Indices

- An **index** is a logical namespace that holds a collection of documents.
- Conceptually similar to a database in RDBMS.
- Each index is made up of one or more shards for scalability.
- Supports settings to configure analyzers, mappings, refresh intervals, and replicas.

## Documents

- A **document** is the basic unit of information indexed in Elasticsearch.
- Stored in JSON format, documents consist of field-value pairs.
- Each document belongs to a type defined in the index (deprecated in newer versions as types are being removed).
- Documents are immutable; updates happen by deleting and reindexing.

## Shards

- An index is divided into **shards** â€“ smaller, more manageable pieces distributed across nodes.
- Each shard is a fully functional Lucene index and can operate independently.
- Sharding enables horizontal scaling by distributing data and load.
- Default shard count is 5 per index but customizable.
- Shards improve parallelism; search queries run across all shards in parallel.

## Replicas

- Elasticsearch provides **replicas** as copies of primary shards.
- Replicas increase fault tolerance and query throughput.
- Replica shards are allocated on different nodes than their primaries for high availability.
- Elasticsearch automatically handles failover if a primary shard goes down by promoting a replica.

## Inverted Index

- At the core of Elasticsearch is the **inverted index**, which maps terms (words) to documents containing those terms.
- Enables efficient full-text searching by optimizing the lookup of terms.
- Supports tokenization and analysis to break text into terms and normalize (lowercase, stemming, stop words).

## Mapping and Data Types

- **Mapping** defines the schema for documents within an index.
- Specifies data types, indexing rules, analyzers, and field configurations.
- Data types include text, keyword, date, numeric types, geo points, and more.
- Dynamic mapping allows Elasticsearch to infer field types at indexing time.

## Query Processing

- Elasticsearch supports a rich query DSL allowing:
  - Full-text queries using analyzed fields.
  - Structured queries for exact matching on keywords.
  - Aggregations for metrics, histograms, and data summaries.
- Queries are distributed across shards and results merged by coordinating nodes.

## Cluster State Management

- Master node manages cluster state updates (new indices, node join/leave, shard relocations).
- This state is propagated to all nodes to ensure consensus.
- Elasticsearch uses a publish-subscribe pattern internally for state updates.

## Data Routing and Balancing

- Documents are routed to shards based on a hash of their ID or a specified routing value.
- Elasticsearch balances shard locations to optimize resource utilization and performance.

## High Availability and Fault Tolerance

- Automatic shard replication and recovery.
- Elastic internally handles node failures by reallocating shards.
- Cluster health indicators (green, yellow, red) reflect shard and replica allocation status.

This detailed internal architecture ensures Elasticsearch is resilient, scalable, and fast, making it ideal for diverse applications, including real-time telecom data analysis and observability.
