# Elasticsearch Use Cases

## Generic Elasticsearch Use Cases

1. **Log and Event Data Analytics**

   - Ingest, parse, and index logs from various systems to enable real-time searching, filtering, and troubleshooting.
   - Popular for centralized logging platforms that support DevOps and incident response.

2. **Full-text Search**

   - Enable fast and flexible search in applications with complex text queries, relevance scoring, and ranking.
   - Supports fuzzy, Boolean, phrase, and proximity searches with high performance.

3. **Security Analytics**

   - Correlate and analyze security event logs for anomaly detection, threat hunting, and compliance reporting.
   - Integrate with SIEM systems to enable real-time alerting and dashboards.

4. **Business Intelligence and Dashboarding**

   - Visualize aggregated data using Kibana or Grafana for monitoring KPIs, operational metrics, and customer insights.
   - Supports drill-downs, filtering, and interactive analysis enabling data-driven decision making.

5. **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**
   - Trace application calls, latency, errors, and transactions using Elastic APM agents.
   - Helps developers and operators monitor distributed systems efficiently.

## Telecom-specific Elasticsearch Use Cases

1. **Call Detail Record (CDR) Analysis**

   - Ingest and index millions of CDRs to perform detailed call analytics such as call duration, call drops, and network usage.
   - Enables quick insights into network performance and customer experience.

2. **Network Fault and Event Monitoring**

   - Process and analyze network event logs to detect faults, outages, or unusual patterns in telecom infrastructure.
   - Supports root cause analysis and proactive alerting.

3. **Subscriber Behavior Analytics**

   - Analyze subscriber logs and data usage patterns for personalized marketing, churn prediction, and service improvement.
   - Processes large volumes of semi-structured telecom datasets efficiently.

4. **Quality of Service (QoS) Monitoring**
   - Monitor metrics like latency, jitter, and packet loss
