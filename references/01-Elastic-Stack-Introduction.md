# Elastic Stack Introduction

## Elasticsearch Background and Releases

Elasticsearch is a powerful, distributed search and analytics engine built on top of Apache Lucene, an open-source information retrieval software library. Since its first release in 2010 by Elastic NV, it has become a core technology for applications requiring high-speed, scalable real-time search and data analytics. Elasticsearch stores data in JSON documents, making it flexible and easily adaptable.

Over the years, Elasticsearch has evolved through multiple releases that added critical enterprise-grade features:

- Initial versions focused on full-text search with a distributed architecture.
- Subsequent releases improved clustering and high availability, node discovery, and multi-tenant capabilities.
- Integration with complementary tools like Logstash, Kibana, and Beats formed what is now called the Elastic Stack.
- Advanced features added later include security (role-based access control, encryption), alerting, machine learning, and the Elastic APM module for application performance monitoring.
  Its broad adoption in telecom and other industries is driven by its ability to ingest large volumes of log and event data, perform complex queries, and deliver insights through visuals and alerts.

## NoSQL vs RDBMS

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases differ fundamentally from traditional Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) in how they store, manage, and query data.

- **RDBMS** store structured data in tables with fixed schemas and use SQL for queries. They support ACID transactions, ensuring data consistency and integrity, making them ideal for financial, transactional, and relational data.
- **NoSQL** databases like Elasticsearch provide schema flexibility, allowing storage of unstructured, semi-structured, or complex hierarchical data formats. They use distributed architectures to scale horizontally across clusters, supporting large volumes of data with high speed.
- NoSQL sacrifices some ACID properties, particularly consistency, to achieve better availability and partition tolerance in distributed environments (as described by the CAP theorem).
- For telecom, where data includes diverse logs, call detail records (CDRs), network events, and metrics that are semi-structured or unstructured, NoSQL’s flexibility and scalable performance make them a preferred choice.

## CAP Theorem

The **CAP Theorem**, formulated by Eric Brewer, is a fundamental concept in distributed systems design, stating that a distributed data system can only guarantee two out of the following three properties at any time:

- **Consistency (C)**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error. All nodes in the system reflect the same data at the same time.
- **Availability (A)**: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
- **Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues to operate even when network partitions (communication failures) occur between nodes.

Elasticsearch, as a distributed NoSQL system, often prioritizes availability and partition tolerance, accepting eventual consistency, which fits telecom scenarios where data availability is critical even during network partitions.

## Elastic Stack

The Elastic Stack is a suite of integrated open-source tools for search, logging, monitoring, and data visualization:

- **Elasticsearch**: The core engine responsible for ingesting, storing, and querying data in near real-time.
- **Logstash**: A server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources, transforms it, and sends it to Elasticsearch.
- **Kibana**: Web-based interface to visualize data indexed in Elasticsearch through charts, graphs, maps, and dashboards.
- **Beats**: Lightweight data shippers installed on client machines to send different types of operational data to Elasticsearch or Logstash.
- **APM (Application Performance Monitoring)**: Enables tracing and monitoring of distributed applications, providing insights into service performance with minimal overhead.

Together, these tools enable telecom organizations to achieve full observability by collecting, processing, analyzing, and visualizing vast volumes of logs, metrics, and traces in real time. This integration supports troubleshooting, business intelligence, and predictive analytics.

## Lucene vs Solr vs Elasticsearch

All three technologies leverage Apache Lucene for core full-text search and indexing capabilities but differ in design, deployment, and target use cases:

- **Lucene** is a high-performance Java search library providing the underlying IR (Information Retrieval) algorithms, but it lacks user-facing services or cluster features and requires custom development for full applications.
- **Solr** is an open-source enterprise search platform built on Lucene, providing rich search capabilities like faceted search, full-text search, hit highlighting, caching, and REST-like APIs. It supports distributed indexing and searching but requires more manual setup and administration than Elasticsearch.
- **Elasticsearch** extends Lucene by offering a fully distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine with dynamic schema support, ease of scaling across clusters, and built-in integration with the Elastic Stack’s visualization (Kibana) and data ingestion tools (Logstash, Beats). It emphasizes simplicity in deployment and cloud-native operation, which explains its widespread adoption in modern analytics and telecom monitoring use cases.

In telecom environments requiring real-time monitoring and scalable log analysis, Elasticsearch is often preferred for its flexibility, scaling capabilities, and ecosystem integration.
